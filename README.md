## I used ChatGPT 3.0

## I see a lot of benefits in just helping with simple syntax. The real danger of this AI method is when you don't know what the code means. Understanding what AI makes is beneficial as you know how to reproduce it yourself and can properly interpret the output and use it well to help businesses. Getting false results can happen, such as logic errors where the code works but what you made does not make sense and the AI would not know to look for that. this can be avoided in many ways but how you input your prompt matters.

## I really had to mkae sure that the AI understodd what to label and also it knew what model I wanted to create. It didn't realize I was bulding off previous things made so I had to tell it to delete importing of libraries a few times. Ai was fun to work with especially when I know what type of analysis I want to make, it can easily interpret my prompt sand very quickly fill in the gaps of the lack of syntax that I gave it and make it look almost word for word what the original notebook looked like.
